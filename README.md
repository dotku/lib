# lib
My frontend libraries

## Standard
* the library path standard is `/packagename/files`
* it would be last stable version by default
* if the package has several versions, it would be `/packagename-version/files`

## usage
You could use them directly from http://dotku.github.io/lib/*,
but due to the github auto deployment mechanism, 
it might not be stable while updating is processing,
so I suggest to download them to your local space.

\* most packages are from bower, some packages might download 
from the official website directly
\* welcome to fork and pull request as you want, thank you!
